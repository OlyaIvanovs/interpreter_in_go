# interpreter_in_go
This project is inspired by the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball and focuses on building a new programming language using Go as the underlying language.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning programming language from scratch, following the principles and techniques outlined in the book. This includes designing and implementing a lexer, parser, and evaluator to interpret and execute code written in the new language.

## Features
- **Custom Language:** Develop a unique programming language with its own syntax and semantics.
- **Lexer and Parser:** Implement a lexer to tokenize source code and a parser to create an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Evaluator:** Build an evaluator that interprets and executes code based on the AST.
